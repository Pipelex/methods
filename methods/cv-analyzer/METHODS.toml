# CV Analyzer

An end-to-end candidate screening pipeline that automates the process of evaluating CVs against job offers and generating appropriate follow-up actions.

## What it does

Given a **candidate CV** (as a document) and a **job offer** (as text), this method:

1. **Extracts** the CV content from the uploaded document into readable pages.
2. **Analyzes the match** between the candidate's profile and the job requirements using an LLM acting as an HR expert. This produces a structured `MatchResult` containing a boolean `is_match` flag and a detailed `match_analysis` explanation.
3. **Routes conditionally** based on the match result:
   - **If the candidate matches**: generates **5 tailored interview questions** that probe relevant experience, skills, and cultural fit, focusing on strengths and gaps identified in the analysis.
   - **If the candidate does not match**: drafts a **professional refusal email** that is courteous, respectful, and references specific reasons from the analysis.

## Concepts

- **MatchResult**: A structured assessment with `is_match` (boolean) and `match_analysis` (text explanation).
- **Email**: A professional email message.
- **InterviewQuestion**: A tailored interview question for a candidate.

## Pipeline overview

`screen_candidate` → `extract_cv` → `analyze_match` → `route_on_match` → (`generate_interview_questions` | `write_refusal_email`)
